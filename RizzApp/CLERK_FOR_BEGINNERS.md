# üéì CLERK AUTHENTICATION - BEGINNER'S GUIDE

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S ALREADY DONE FOR YOU

I've set up everything! Here's what I did:

### 1. **Installed Software** ‚úì
- Added Clerk packages to your app
- These are like installing apps on your phone

### 2. **Connected Clerk** ‚úì

- This wraps your entire app with Clerk protection

### 3. **Added Your Secret Key** ‚úì
- Put your Clerk key in `.env` file
- This connects YOUR app to YOUR Clerk account

### 4. **Created Login Screens** ‚úì
- `clerk-signin.tsx` - For existing users

## üîç UNDERSTANDING THE FILES

<ClerkProvider publishableKey={YOUR_KEY}>
  <YourApp />
</ClerkProvider>
```

**Think of it like:** Putting a security guard at the entrance of your app

**Content:**
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx...
```

**Think of it like:** Your app's ID card to talk to Clerk

### File 3: `app/(auth)/clerk-signin.tsx`

3. Clerk sends verification email
4. User enters 6-digit code
5. Clerk verifies code

## üé® HOW TO USE IN YOUR APP

### Option A: Replace Your Current Login

In your existing `login.tsx`, add a button:

```tsx
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => router.push('/(auth)/clerk-signin')}>
  <Text>Try Clerk Authentication</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### Option B: Add to Navigation

Navigate programmatically:
```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';

const router = useRouter();
router.push('/(auth)/clerk-signin');  // Go to Clerk login
```

### Option C: Check if User is Logged In

```tsx
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';

function MyScreen() {
  const { isSignedIn, userId } = useAuth();
  
  if (isSignedIn) {
    return <Text>Welcome! User ID: {userId}</Text>;
  }
  
  return <Text>Please log in</Text>;
}
```

### Option D: Get User Info

```tsx
import { useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';

function ProfileScreen() {
  const { user } = useUser();
  
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Email: {user?.emailAddresses[0].emailAddress}</Text>
      <Text>ID: {user?.id}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Option E: Sign Out

```tsx
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';

function SignOutButton() {
  const { signOut } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <Button 
      title="Sign Out" 
      onPress={() => signOut()} 
    />
  );
}
```

## üí° IMPORTANT CONCEPTS

### What is a "Session"?
When you log in, Clerk creates a "session" - think of it like a ticket that says "This person is logged in". This ticket is saved on your phone and checked every time you open the app.

### What is "Token Cache"?
This is where your login ticket is stored securely on your phone. We use `expo-secure-store` for this (like a safe on your phone).

### What is "Verification"?
To make sure you own the email address, Clerk sends a code. This prevents fake accounts.

### What is "pk_test_"?
This is your TEST key. When your app is ready for real users, you'll get a `pk_live_` key instead.

---

## üöÄ YOU'RE READY!

Everything is set up. Just:
1. Open your app
2. Navigate to the Clerk screens
3. Test creating an account
4. Test logging in

That's it! Clerk handles all the security for you! üéâ

# 📬 Notification System - User Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Expo Go Limitations

### You're Currently Using Expo Go

**What This Means:**
- ✅ **Notifications ARE working** - they're just logged to the console
- ❌ **Popup notifications won't appear** on your device screen
- ✅ **WebSocket real-time updates work perfectly**
- ✅ **All notification logic is functioning correctly**

### Where to See Notifications in Expo Go

When you create a project or expense, check your **development console** (terminal/Metro bundler) for logs like:

```
🧪 Testing PROJECT_CREATED notification...
📬 [Expo Go] Notification: 🎉 New Project Created - Project "Test Office Renovation" has been created successfully
✅ Project creation notification sent
```

```
📬 [Expo Go] Notification: 💰 New Expense Added - Expense of ₹5,000.00 has been added to "Office Renovation"
✅ Expense creation notification sent
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see any notifications!"

**Solution:** You won't see popup notifications in Expo Go. Check your **console/terminal** instead.

**Steps:**
1. Open the terminal where `npm start` or `npx expo start` is running
2. Look for logs starting with 📬
3. Create a project or expense
4. The notification log should appear within 1 second

---

### "I don't see logs in console either!"

**Check 1: Notifications are enabled**
```
Go to Profile → Notifications
Make sure "Push Notifications" toggle is ON
```

**Check 2: Console is visible**
```
Make sure your Metro bundler terminal is visible
Or check the Expo Dev Tools browser window
```

**Check 3: Create test notification**
```
1. Go to Profile → Notifications
2. Tap "Test Project Created" button
3. You should see an alert AND console log
```

**Check 4: Verify notification service**
```
Look for this log when app starts:
⚠️ Push notifications not supported in Expo Go. Use a development build for full support.
```

If you see that log, the system is working correctly!

# 🔧 Quick Fix for Notifications Not Appearing

## Problem
You toggled the "Push Notifications" switch OFF, which disabled notifications. Even if you turned it back ON, the setting might be stuck.

## Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Reload the App
Press `r` in your Expo terminal or shake your device and tap "Reload"

### Step 2: Fix Notification Settings
1. Open the app
2. Go to **Profile** tab (bottom navigation)
3. Tap **"Notifications"**
4. Scroll all the way down to the Test section
5. Tap the **yellow "Fix Notification Settings"** button
6. You'll see an alert: "Settings Fixed!"

### Step 3: Test It
Tap **"Test Project Created"** button

**Watch your terminal** - you should now see:
```
🧪 Testing PROJECT_CREATED notification...
🔍 Checking notification settings: {...}
✅ Push notifications value: true
✅ Push notifications are ENABLED
🔔 sendAppNotification called with type: project_created
📬 [Expo Go] Notification: 🎉 New Project Created - Project "Test Office Renovation" has been created successfully
```

## Alternative: Manual Toggle

If the fix button doesn't work:
1. Go to Profile → Notifications
2. Make sure "Push Notifications" switch is **ON** (purple/blue color)
3. If it's already ON, toggle it OFF then ON again
4. Test again

## Verify It's Working

Create a real project:
1. Go to **Projects** tab
2. Tap **+** button
3. Enter project name (e.g., "Test Office")
4. Tap Save
5. **Check terminal immediately**

You should see:
```
🔔 Attempting to send project creation notification...
🔍 Checking notification settings: {...}
✅ Push notifications are ENABLED
🔔 Calling sendAppNotification...
📬 [Expo Go] Notification: 🎉 New Project Created - Project "Test Office" has been created successfully
✅ Project creation notification sent
```

## Still Not Working?

Copy the console output and look for:
- `⚠️ Push notifications are DISABLED in settings` - Settings are OFF
- `🔍 Checking notification settings: {"pushNotifications":false...}` - Needs fix
- No logs at all - App needs reload

## What You Should See

✅ **In Console/Terminal:**
```
📬 [Expo Go] Notification: 🎉 New Project Created...
```

❌ **NOT on your device screen** (Expo Go limitation)

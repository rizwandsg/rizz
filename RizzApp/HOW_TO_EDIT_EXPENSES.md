## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Edit button not visible?
- Make sure you're viewing an expense (ExpenseDetails screen)
- Look in the top-right corner of the screen
- It's a pencil icon next to the delete (trash) icon

### Fields not updating?
- Make sure you tap "Update Expense" button
- Check for error messages
- Verify all required fields are filled (description, amount, project, scope)

### Vendor/Payment fields not showing?
- Make sure VENDOR_PAYMENT_ENABLED = true in AddExpense.tsx (line 18)
- Make sure database migration was run successfully

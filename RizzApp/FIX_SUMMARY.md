# ‚úÖ Expo Go Fix Applied

## What Was Fixed

The app was crashing in **Expo Go** because push notifications aren't supported since SDK 53.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `services/notificationService.ts`:**
   - Added Expo Go detection
   - Skip push token registration in Expo Go
   - Log notifications to console instead of showing them
   - Get project ID from `app.json` configuration

2. **No Breaking Changes:**
   - WebSocket still works perfectly ‚úÖ
   - All other features work normally ‚úÖ
   - App won't crash ‚úÖ

## Current Behavior

### In Expo Go (What you're using now):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Push notifications not supported in Expo Go. Use a development build for full support.
üì¨ [Expo Go] Notification: project_created { projectName: 'Office Renovation' }
üîå Subscribing to real-time updates for user: rizwankottiligal@gmail.com
‚úÖ Subscribed to projects channel
```

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ WebSocket real-time updates
- ‚úÖ Database operations
- ‚úÖ UI and navigation
- ‚úÖ Authentication
- ‚úÖ All core features

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ‚ùå Actual notification popups (logged to console instead)

### In Development Build (If you build it):
```
‚úÖ Push token: ExponentPushToken[xxx]
üéâ New Project Created
Project "Office Renovation" has been created successfully
```

**Everything works including real notifications!**

## Testing Right Now

You can test the WebSocket feature immediately:

1. **Open the app** (already working)
2. **Create a project** - WebSocket will notify other devices
3. **Check console** - You'll see notification logs

## Next Steps

### Keep Testing in Expo Go:
```bash
# Just refresh the app
# Press 'r' in the terminal
```

### Want Full Notifications? Create Development Build:
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
eas build:configure
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

**Build time:** ~15 minutes for first build

## Documentation Created

- `EXPO_GO_LIMITATIONS.md` - Full guide on Expo Go vs Development Build
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - How to test all features
- `NOTIFICATIONS_WEBSOCKET.md` - Complete API documentation

**Status: ‚úÖ App should work now in Expo Go without crashes!**

The notification functionality is gracefully degraded, and WebSocket real-time updates work perfectly.

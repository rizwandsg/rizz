# 🔧 Fix for Missing Device Notifications

## What Happened

The notification detection was incorrectly identifying your app as "Expo Go" and blocking actual notifications from showing on your device.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Expo Go Detection**
   - Changed from `Constants.appOwnership` to `Constants.executionEnvironment`
   - Now correctly detects: Expo Go vs Development Build vs Production Build

2. **Added Debugging Logs**
   - Shows execution environment on app start
   - Logs when notifications are scheduled
   - Shows if notification handler is configured

3. **Fixed Notification Handler**
   - Notification handler now properly configured at module load
   - Ensures notifications show even when app is in foreground

## How to Test

### Step 1: Reload Your App
Press `r` in your Expo terminal

### Step 2: Check Console on App Load

You should see:
```
🔍 Notification Service - Execution Environment: standalone (or bare)
🔍 Notification Service - App Ownership: null (or standalone)
🔍 Notification Service - Is Expo Go: false
✅ Notification handler configured
```

**Important:** If you see `Is Expo Go: true`, that's the problem!

### Step 3: Test with Button

1. Go to Profile → Notifications
2. Tap "Test Project Created"
3. Check console AND your device

**Expected Console:**
```
🧪 Testing PROJECT_CREATED notification...
🔍 Checking notification settings: ...
✅ Push notifications are ENABLED
🔔 sendAppNotification called with type: project_created
📱 scheduleLocalNotification called: 🎉 New Project Created
📱 isExpoGo: false
📱 Attempting to schedule actual notification...
✅ Notification scheduled successfully! ID: xxx
✅ Notification should appear on device now
```

**Expected on Device:**
- 🔔 Notification popup appears!
- Sound plays
- Shows: "🎉 New Project Created"
- Body: "Project 'Test Office Renovation' has been created successfully"

### Step 4: Test with Real Project

1. Go to Projects tab
2. Create a new project
3. Save it
4. **Notification should appear on your device!**

## Troubleshooting

### If Console Shows "Is Expo Go: true"

**Problem:** App is running in Expo Go (which doesn't support notifications)

**Solution:** You need to use a development build or production build
```bash
npx expo run:android
# OR
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### If Console Shows "Is Expo Go: false" but No Notification

**Check 1: Notification Permissions**
- Go to device Settings → Apps → YourApp → Notifications
- Make sure notifications are enabled

**Check 2: Do Not Disturb**
- Check if your device is in Do Not Disturb mode
- Turn it off and try again

**Check 3: App Settings**
- Go to Profile → Notifications in app
- Make sure "Push Notifications" toggle is ON
- Tap "Fix Notification Settings" button

**Check 4: Console Errors**
Look for red error messages like:
```
❌ Error scheduling notification: ...
```
Share this error if you see it.

### If You're in Expo Go

Expo Go cannot show popup notifications since SDK 53. You have two options:

**Option A: Accept Console Logs Only**
- Notifications will be logged to console
- Good for quick testing
- No device popups

**Option B: Build Development Build**
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login
eas login

# Configure
eas build:configure

# Build
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Install the APK and run
npx expo start --dev-client
```

## Expected Behavior by Environment

### Expo Go (storeClient)
```
🔍 Is Expo Go: true
⚠️ Push notifications not supported in Expo Go
📬 [Expo Go] Notification: ... (console only)
```
❌ No device popups

### Development Build (standalone/bare)
```
🔍 Is Expo Go: false
✅ Notification handler configured
📱 Attempting to schedule actual notification...
✅ Notification scheduled successfully!
```
✅ Device popups appear!

### Production Build
```
🔍 Is Expo Go: false
✅ Notification handler configured
📱 Attempting to schedule actual notification...
✅ Notification scheduled successfully!
```
✅ Device popups appear!

## Quick Verification

1. **Reload app** → Check console for "Is Expo Go: false"
2. **Tap test button** → Check for "✅ Notification scheduled successfully!"
3. **Check device** → Notification should appear
4. **Create project** → Notification should appear

If all 4 work = ✅ FIXED!

## What You Should See Now

### Before (Broken):
```
🔍 Is Expo Go: true
📬 [Expo Go] Notification: ... (console only)
```
❌ No device notification

### After (Fixed):
```
🔍 Is Expo Go: false
📱 Attempting to schedule actual notification...
✅ Notification scheduled successfully!
```
✅ Device notification appears!

**Reload your app now and test it!** The notifications should appear on your device again.

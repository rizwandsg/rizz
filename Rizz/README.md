# RIZ Travel App - Production Architecture

**Cloud-native, microservices-ready travel planning platform with operator collaboration & marketplace**

## Overview

RIZ is a scalable travel planning application designed to help travelers budget, plan itineraries, optimize transport, and collaborate with tourism operators. Built for millions of users with real-time pricing, seasonality intelligence, and multi-modal transport optimization.

## Architecture Highlights

- **Microservices**: Domain-driven design with 13+ services
- **Event-driven**: Kafka-based async workflows
- **Hybrid storage**: Postgres + Cassandra + OpenSearch + Redis
- **ML-powered**: Price forecasting, recommendations, personalization

- **Scalability**: Horizontal auto-scaling, read replicas, CDN edge

## Core Services

1. **API Gateway** - Auth, rate-limiting, routing
2. **Auth/IAM** - OAuth2, JWT, roles, organizations
3. **User Profile** - Preferences, saved trips, payment tokens
4. **Trip Service** - Trip CRUD, collaboration, sharing
5. **Budgeting Engine** - Category budgets, seasonality, scenarios
6. **Planner/Itinerary** - Day-by-day scheduling, time windows
7. **Pricing Aggregator** - Multi-provider price collection & caching
8. **Search Service** - Geo-search, POIs, activities (OpenSearch)
9. **Transport Optimizer** - Multi-modal routing (cost/time/comfort)
10. **Recommendation Engine** - ML-based suggestions
11. **Marketplace/Operators** - Listings, offers, contracts
12. **Booking & Payments** - Stripe/Adyen integration, invoices
13. **Notifications** - Email, push, SMS, webhooks
14. **Analytics** - Data lake, ML training pipelines
15. **Admin Portal** - Dashboards, disputes, payouts

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Languages**: Python (FastAPI), Node.js (NestJS), Go (performance-critical services)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (primary), Cassandra (time-series), Redis (cache)
- **Search**: OpenSearch/Elasticsearch
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (GKE/EKS)

### Frontend
- **Mobile**: React Native (iOS/Android)
- **Web**: React SPA with Next.js
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + RTK Query

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud**: GCP/AWS (multi-cloud capable)

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Budgeting Engine
- Category-based cost calculation with recurring items
- Seasonality multipliers by location & date
- Contingency & tax/fee estimation
- Per-person splitting with explainability
- Integer-cent arithmetic (no floating-point errors)

### 2. Itinerary Generation
- Candidate activity scoring (preference, rating, cost, distance)
- Greedy day-packing with time windows
- Travel time integration via routing service
- Budget-aware scheduling with swap suggestions

### 3. Transport Optimization
- Multi-modal graph with cost/time/CO2/comfort edges
- Multi-Label Dijkstra for Pareto frontier
- Three ranked options: cheapest, fastest, balanced
- GTFS integration for local transit

### 4. Date & Price Optimization
- Time-series analysis of historical prices
- Sliding window search (±14 days)
- Dynamic programming for cheapest window
- Anomaly detection & smoothing

### 5. Budget Optimization (What-If)
- Discrete alternatives per major category
- Knapsack-like solver for hard constraints
- Heuristic pruning (top 3 per category)
- Delta computation via budget engine

## Data Model

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Travelers, operators, admins
- **Organizations/Operators**: Tourism providers, KYC, payouts
- **Trips**: Multi-traveler with collaboration & privacy
- **Trip Items**: Line items with categories & costs
- **Season Profiles**: Location-based multipliers by month
- **Price Points**: Time-series price history (Cassandra)
- **POIs**: Searchable points of interest (OpenSearch)
- **Bookings**: Provider integrations with status tracking
- **Operator Listings**: Experiences, availability, pricing

## API Design

### REST Endpoints (v1)
```
POST   /v1/trips
GET    /v1/trips/{id}
POST   /v1/trips/{id}/budget/compute
GET    /v1/locations/{id}/season-profile
GET    /v1/search?lat&lon&q=activities
POST   /v1/planner/{trip_id}/generate
GET    /v1/transport/options?origin&dest&date
POST   /v1/bookings
POST   /v1/operators/onboard
GET    /v1/marketplace/listings
```

### GraphQL (Client-driven)
- Flexible trip queries with nested data
- Batch loading for performance
- Real-time subscriptions for collaboration

## Scaling Strategy

### Capacity Targets
- **Users**: 1M+ registered, 100K DAU
- **API Throughput**: 10K RPS burst capacity
- **Latency**: p95 < 200ms for reads, < 1s for compute
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA

### Patterns
- Horizontal auto-scaling (HPA on k8s)
- Database read replicas + sharding (by tenant)
- Redis cluster for distributed caching
- Kafka partitioning for parallel processing
- CDN for static assets & API responses
- Circuit breakers for external APIs
- Worker pools with rate limiting
- Blue-green & canary deployments

## Security & Compliance

- **Authentication**: OAuth2, JWT, 2FA
- **Authorization**: RBAC with fine-grained permissions
- **Payments**: PCI-DSS compliant (tokenized via Stripe)
- **KYC/AML**: Operator verification flows
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR, CCPA compliance
- **Encryption**: TLS in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **WAF**: DDoS protection, rate limiting
- **Audit Logging**: All sensitive operations tracked

## Collaboration & Marketplace

### For Travelers
- Multi-user trip collaboration (roles, permissions)
- Real-time comments & chat
- Shared budget visibility
- Booking coordination

### For Operators
- Self-service listing creation
- Dynamic pricing & availability calendars
- Promotional campaigns & time-limited offers
- Booking webhooks & confirmations
- Performance analytics dashboard
- Payout management & dispute resolution

### Business Models
- Commission on bookings (10-15%)
- Operator subscription tiers (premium placement)
- B2B packages for tourism boards
- API monetization for integrators

## ML & Data Science

### Models
- **Price Forecasting**: LightGBM time-series models
- **Recommendations**: Embedding-based ranking (LambdaMART)

- **Seasonality Detection**: Prophet + anomaly scoring

### Infrastructure
- **Training**: Airflow pipelines on GPU clusters
- **Feature Store**: Feast or custom solution
- **Inference**: TensorFlow Serving / Triton
- **Monitoring**: Model drift detection, A/B testing

## Observability

- **Metrics**: Prometheus (latency, errors, saturation)
- **Dashboards**: Grafana with SLO tracking
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed request flows
- **Logs**: Structured logging (JSON) → ELK/Loki
- **Alerts**: PagerDuty integration for incidents
- **SLIs/SLOs**: Per-service reliability targets
